first time used customtkinter, looks cool, at least way better than previous stuff that I made with tkinter
so this thing is just a random clicking thing, and I made it cuz wanted to find out the customtkinter's "potential", and it didn't disappoint me thankfully
And I made some kind of poorly made authorising system
User - 123123, Password - 123123
User - admin, Password - admin (Overpowered account)
User - user1, Password - user1
